## UNIT TESTING
### what is unit testing?
-  unit testing is a way of testing individual pieces of code to make sure that they work as expected. Unit tests are     typically written by the developers of the code, and they are run frequently, often as part of the development process.
-  The mvn test command is used to run unit tests in a Maven project.
-  When you run the mvn test command, Maven will first compile your project's source code. Then, it will run all of the unit tests in your project. If any of the unit tests fail, Maven 
   will stop the build process and print the errors to the console.

-  The mvn test command can be used to run all of the unit tests in a project, or it can be used to run a specific set of unit tests. To run a specific set of unit tests, you can use the -    Dtest parameter. For example, the following command will run all of the unit tests in the com.example.myproject package:

```
mvn test -Dtest=com.example.myproject
```
You can also use the -Dtest parameter to run a specific unit test class or method. For example, the following command will run the MyTest class:

```
mvn test -Dtest=MyTest
```



## INTEGRATION TESTING
### what is Integration Testing
-  Integration testing is a software testing technique that focuses on verifying the interactions and interfaces between different components or modules of a system to ensure that they work correctly together as a whole. Integration tests are performed to identify and address issues that may arise when multiple components are integrated, such as communication problems, data mismatches, or compatibility issues.

*Database Integration*: Verifying that the application interacts correctly with a database (e.g., CRUD operations, data retrieval, and transactions).

*Service Integration*: Testing the integration of various services or components within the application, including RESTful services, microservices, or external APIs.

*External Systems* Integration: Ensuring that the application interacts properly with external systems or services, such as message queues, cloud services, or third-party APIs.

*Configuration Integration*: Testing how the application behaves with different configurations, including different databases, environments (e.g., development, testing, production), and settings.

To perform integration testing using Maven in a Java project

### Set Up the Project Structure:
-  Organize your integration tests in a separate directory structure within your project. Conventionally, integration tests are placed in a directory like src/test/java alongside unit tests.
